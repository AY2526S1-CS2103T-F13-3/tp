### Steps to take

1. **Check your system requirements**

   Make sure you have **Java 17 or above** installed on your computer.
   You can verify this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   `java -version`
   If Java is not installed, download it from [Oracle’s JDK 17 page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or use [OpenJDK 17](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/).

2. **Download the latest release**

   Go to the [_Releases_](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/releases) page of our GitHub repository and download the latest `.jar` file.

3. **Run the application**

   Open a terminal in the folder containing the downloaded `.jar` file and run:
   `java -jar playbook.jar`
   The application window should appear, ready for use.

4. **Saving your data**

   The app automatically saves your data to a JSON file on your computer whenever changes are made.
   You do not need to manually save your progress.

5. **Getting help**

   Within the app, type `help` to get a link for our UserGuide.
   You can also refer to the [_User Guide_](UserGuide.md) for detailed instructions and examples.
