## Tips and Best Practices

### Effective Workflows

**Daily Management:**
1. Start each day with `refresh` to see all your data
2. Use `find -an [name]` to quickly locate specific athletes
3. Check contract expiry dates regularly with `find -cs [sport]`
4. Keep contact information updated for all entities

**Contract Negotiation Season:**
1. Use `find -ca [athlete]` to see all contracts for an athlete
2. Cross-reference with `find -co [organization]` to see organization's other deals
3. Track contract amounts and dates systematically
4. Add new contracts immediately after signing

**Data Organization:**
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., "FC Barcelona" vs "Barcelona FC")
- Include full legal names for organizations
- Keep email and phone information current
- Group related contracts by using similar start/end date patterns

### Common Pitfalls & Solutions

**Problem:** "Athlete not found" when adding contracts  
**Solution:** Use `find -an [name]` first to verify the exact name spelling

**Problem:** Accidentally deleted important data  
**Solution:** Data is automatically saved after each command - restart the application to restore the previous state

**Problem:** Too many search results  
**Solution:** Use more specific keywords or combine with tab switching

**Problem:** Slow performance with large datasets  
**Solution:** Use search filters regularly instead of browsing all data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### Display and Window Issues

**Problem:** Application window opens off-screen after disconnecting a monitor  
**Cause:** The application remembers its last window position from preferences.json. If the app was last open on a secondary monitor and that monitor is disconnected, the window tries to open in the same (now nonexistent) location  
**Solution:** Delete the `preferences.json` file before launching the app again to reset window position

**Problem:** Help Window remains minimized and does not reopen  
**Cause:** If the Help Window is already open and minimized, invoking the help command again does not spawn a new window ‚Äî the existing window simply remains minimized  
**Solution:** Manually restore the minimized Help Window

### Common Error Messages

**"Command not recognized"**
- Check spelling of command name
- Ensure you're using the correct flags (e.g., `-an` not `-name`)
- See [Command Reference](#command-reference) for exact syntax

**"Invalid date format"**
- Use DDMMYYYY format only (e.g., 25122024)
- No spaces, dashes, or slashes in dates
- Ensure day/month values are valid (01-31 for days, 01-12 for months)

**"Athlete/Organization not found"**
- Use `find` commands to locate the exact name
- Check for typos or extra spaces
- Names are case-sensitive and must match exactly

**"Duplicate entry"**
- Athlete name + sport combinations must be unique
- Organization names must be unique
- Try slightly different name variations if needed

### Performance Issues

**Large datasets (1000+ entries):**
- Use search filters instead of browsing all data
- Close and restart the application weekly
- Consider archiving old contracts to separate files

**Slow startup:**
- Check available disk space (need 50MB minimum)
- Ensure Java version is 17 or higher
- Try moving to a different folder location
