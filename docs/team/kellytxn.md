### Project: playbook.io

**playbook.io** is a platform that helps sports agents efficiently manage athletes, organizations, and contracts. It combines the speed of a Command Line Interface with the ease of a Graphical User Interface, enabling agents to stay organized, build stronger relationships, and focus on closing deals.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

---

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete athletes. [\#50](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/pull/50)
    * **What it does:** Enables users to add new athletes to the system or delete existing ones.
    * **Justification:** Core functionality of the application, as managing athletes is central to a sports agent’s workflow. Without this feature, users would be unable to maintain an accurate athlete database.
    * **Highlights:** Implementing this required creating new model classes, updating the command and parser structures, and ensuring seamless integration with existing data storage. Care was taken to maintain consistency in validation and error handling.
    * **Credits:** Based on the AddressBook-Level 3 codebase, adapted and extended for playbook.io’s athlete management context.
