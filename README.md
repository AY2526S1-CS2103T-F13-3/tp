- This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
- The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _playbook.io_) used for managing athletes and partners.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
- For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[playbook.io product website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f13-3.github.io/tp/)**.
